 # Principles of Secure Development

Secure development is the practice of designing, building, and maintaining software with security in mind from the outset. It's an essential skill for developers, team leaders, system architects, application security personnel, and anyone involved in creating software. In this 40-hour secure development course, we will cover the following subsections of principles of secure development:

## Security by Design

*Security by Design (SbD)* is an approach that emphasizes security throughout all stages of development—planning, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance. In SbD, security isn't an afterthought; it's a core part of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

*Example:* Considering an application that stores sensitive user information. Instead of adding encryption as an afterthought when dealing with data in transit or at rest, the development team applies security controls during each SDLC stage. During planning, they consider security requirements and allocate resources accordingly. In design, they develop a secure architecture by choosing appropriate protocols and designing a secure access control mechanism. During implementation, they write code following best practices for handling encryption keys, managing sessions, and validating input to prevent attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

*Exploit:* If security wasn't considered during design, development might overlook potential vulnerabilities. For example, a developer might choose to use an outdated or insecure algorithm for encryption—an easily crackable DES instead of the more secure AES—leaving user data at risk.

## Identity and Access Control

*Identity and Access Control (I&AC)* determines who gets access to what resources within your system. Proper I&AC ensures that only authorized individuals can access sensitive information, preventing unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential damage to your organization's reputation.

*Example:* You have a web application where users should be able to edit their profiles but not others'. To implement this functionality, you can use access control lists (ACLs) to specify the permissions for different user groups or individual users. For instance, each user's account could have an associated ACL defining which resources they can read or modify.

*Exploit:* If I&AC isn't handled correctly, unauthorized users may be able to bypass access controls and gain sensitive information or unintended permissions. For example, a developer might accidentally grant all users the ability to edit another user's profile instead of just their own.

## Secrets Management

*Secrets Management* ensures that secrets like encryption keys, passwords, and other sensitive data are handled securely throughout their entire lifecycle: creation, storage, distribution, and disposal.

*Example:* When implementing a new feature, you need to create an API key for an external service. To manage this secret, you can use a dedicated secrets management system like HashiCorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. This system securely stores the keys, rotates them regularly, and provides access controls for authorized users to retrieve them as needed.

*Exploit:* If secrets aren't managed properly, they may be exposed through various means: stolen credentials in a repository, misconfigured access permissions, or even physical theft of hardware. A developer might accidentally commit their API key to version control, allowing anyone with access to that repository to use the key maliciously.

## Error Handling

*Error Handling* refers to how your application handles unexpected situations like user input validation errors or system failures. Proper error handling minimizes the potential impact of these issues and prevents unintended consequences for users.

*Example:* When a user inputs invalid data (e.g., an incorrectly formatted email address), your application can provide informative and helpful error messages instead of cryptic ones that might confuse or frustrate users. These messages should guide the user to correct their input.

*Exploit:* If error handling isn't done correctly, attackers may use this information to exploit vulnerabilities. For example, a poorly implemented error message could reveal more sensitive data than intended, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other malicious activities.

## Logging and Monitoring

*Logging and Monitoring* track and record events within your system to help identify and respond to security incidents and troubleshoot issues. Logs can be used for various purposes like detecting intrusions, identifying misconfigurations, and performing forensic analysis.

*Example:* In an e-commerce application, log data might include user activity, API calls, and other relevant events. Developers can use this information to identify unusual activity, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address. Monitoring these logs helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

*Exploit:* If logging and monitoring aren't configured appropriately, attackers may be able to bypass detection or evade analysis. For example, an attacker might use tools to delete or modify log data, making it difficult to trace their activities.

## System Configuration

*System Configuration* ensures that your applications and infrastructure are securely set up and configured. This includes applying security patches, setting access control policies, managing certificates, and more.

*Example:* When deploying a new application, you need to apply various security configurations to ensure the software runs securely. This might include setting up firewalls, configuring SSL/TLS encryption, applying security patches, and more.

*Exploit:* If system configuration isn't done correctly, your applications could be vulnerable to attackers. For instance, an unpatched web server could be exploited using known vulnerabilities that have already been addressed through updates.

## Cryptographic Practices

*Cryptographic Practices* involve using cryptography techniques to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. Proper use of cryptography helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or tampering.

*Example:* In an e-commerce application, you might use SSL/TLS encryption to secure communication between users' browsers and your servers. This ensures that data transmitted during transactions remains confidential.

*Exploit:* If cryptographic practices aren't implemented correctly, sensitive data can be at risk. For example, a developer might use an insecure encryption algorithm like DES, leaving user passwords vulnerable to cracking by attackers.

## Input Validation and Output Encoding

*Input Validation and Output Encoding* help prevent various types of attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection. Proper validation ensures that user input is valid, while encoding ensures that output doesn't contain potentially harmful code snippets.

*Example:* In a web application, you can use input validation to check whether a form field contains expected data types like numbers or email addresses. Output encoding, on the other hand, converts potentially malicious code into harmless characters so that it doesn't execute in the user's browser.

*Exploit:* If input validation and output encoding aren't used properly, attackers may be able to bypass your security measures. For example, an attacker might enter malicious SQL queries through a form field, exploiting vulnerabilities and potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data.

## Threat Modeling

*Threat Modeling* is the process of identifying potential threats to your application or system and assessing their risk levels. This knowledge helps developers make informed decisions about how to allocate resources and prioritize security improvements.

*Example:* In a new project, you can create a threat model by first understanding your assets (e.g., user data) and then brainstorming potential threats (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). You then evaluate the likelihood and impact of each threat to determine their risk levels. This information helps guide development priorities and resource allocation.

*Exploit:* If threat modeling isn't done thoroughly or accurately, your application may be vulnerable to unforeseen risks. For example, a developer might overlook a new attack vector like server-side request forgery (SSRF), leaving the application open to attacks that could previously have been prevented with proper threat modeling and mitigation strategies.
