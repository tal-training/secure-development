 # Protect Data at Rest: Securing Your Data in Databases

In this lesson, we will dive into the importance of protecting data at rest in databases, which is crucial in maintaining the overall security posture of your applications. We'll cover key subsections essential to database security: Database Security Overview, Database Connection, Managing Logins, Storing Sensitive Data, and Database Configuration and Hardening.

## Database Security Overview

To begin with, let's set the foundation by understanding what we mean by "data at rest." Data at rest is any data that is not being actively used or processed, such as data stored in databases or backup files. Securing this data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction is vital to prevent potential damage or data breaches.

Database security is the practice of implementing and maintaining appropriate measures to protect a database from threats both within and outside an organization. This includes controlling who has access to the data, ensuring that all communications between the application and the database are secure, and applying patches and updates as necessary to stay up-to-date with known vulnerabilities.

## Database Connection

One critical aspect of securing data at rest is managing how applications connect to databases. Establishing secure connections involves setting up encryption for data in transit between the application and the database, using secure authentication protocols such as SSL/TLS, and applying firewall rules to restrict access to the database server.

For example, consider a popular web application that relies on an SQL database to store user information. An attacker attempting to exploit this application might try to intercept the connection between the web application and the database to steal sensitive data in transit. To prevent such attacks, it's essential to configure the connection using SSL/TLS encryption to secure the communication channel.

## Managing Logins

Another crucial aspect of securing data at rest is managing user logins for databases. This includes setting strong passwords for database users and limiting access based on the principle of least privilege (PoLP). Implementing PoLP means granting only the necessary level of access to each user, which reduces the risk of unintended consequences from over-permissions.

A common attack targeting databases is brute-force attacks, where attackers try different combinations of usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access. To defend against such attacks, use complex and unique passwords for each database login and employ multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.

## Storing Sensitive Data

Properly storing sensitive data is essential to protecting it at rest in a database. This often involves encrypting the data to make it unreadable if intercepted, and implementing access controls that limit who can view or modify the data based on need-to-know principles.

For instance, when designing an application, it's generally not recommended to store sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers directly in a database table. Instead, consider using techniques like salted hashing, such as bcrypt or scrypt, and storing the hashed values rather than the plaintext data.

## Database Configuration and Hardening

Database configuration and hardening refer to the processes of securing the underlying database platform and its configuration settings to minimize vulnerabilities and potential attack surfaces. This involves implementing firewall rules to restrict external access, enabling strong encryption algorithms, applying security patches promptly, and following best practices for user management.

A prime example of database misconfiguration is leaving default or easily guessable passwords on database instances open to the internet. Attackers can quickly find these unsecured databases using automated tools like Shodan or BinaryEdge and exploit them to gain access to sensitive data. Ensuring that strong, complex passwords are in place for all database users and implementing strict access control policies goes a long way toward preventing such attacks.

In conclusion, securing data at rest within databases is an essential aspect of application security that involves several subsections: Database Security Overview, Database Connection, Managing Logins, Storing Sensitive Data, and Database Configuration and Hardening. By understanding these concepts and implementing the recommended practices for each, you'll be well-equipped to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
