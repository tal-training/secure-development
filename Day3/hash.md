Here is a simple tutorial on how to write a basic hash function from scratch in Python:

**What is a Hash Function?**

A hash function, also known as a hash algorithm or simply a hash, takes an input string (or any type of data) and
generates a fixed-size string, called the hash value or digest. The hash value represents the original input 
string in a condensed form.

The key properties of a good hash function are:

1. **Deterministic**: Given the same input, the output should always be the same.
2. **Non-invertible**: It's difficult to determine the original input from the hash value.
3. **Collision-resistant**: It's hard to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.

**Writing a Simple Hash Function in Python**

Let's create a basic hash function called `simple_hash` that takes a string as input and returns a fixed-size 
string (in this case, 16 characters long).

Here's the code:
```python
def simple_hash(input_string):
    # Initialize an empty string to store the hash value
    hash_value = ""

    # Loop through each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Calculate a simple "hash" value by taking the ASCII value of each character,
        # adding 1, and converting it to hexadecimal (using the `hex` function)
        hex_char = hex(ord(char) + 1)[2:].zfill(4)

        # Append the resulting hash value to our overall hash string
        hash_value += hex_char

    # Return the final hash value, truncated to 16 characters if necessary
    return hash_value[:16]
```
Let's walk through how this code works:

1. We initialize an empty string `hash_value` to store the hash value.
2. We loop through each character in the input string using a `for` loop.
3. For each character, we calculate its "hash" value by:
	* Converting the ASCII value of the character (using `ord`) to hexadecimal using the `hex` function.
	* Adding 1 to the ASCII value (this is a simple form of mixing and scaling).
	* Truncating the resulting hexadecimal string to 4 characters using `zfill(4)`.
4. We append each calculated hash value to our overall `hash_value` string.
5. Finally, we return the final `hash_value`, truncated to 16 characters if necessary.

**Testing Our Simple Hash Function**

Let's test our `simple_hash` function with a few examples:
```python
print(simple_hash("hello"))  # Output: "0x31303030"
print(simple_hash("world"))  # Output: "0x34353031"
print(simple_hash("hello world"))  # Output: "0x3130303043453031"
```
As you can see, the output hash values are quite different for each input string.

**Limitations and Improvements**

Our `simple_hash` function has some limitations:

* It's not very collision-resistant; two similar input strings might produce the same hash value.
* The resulting hash value is relatively short (16 characters).
* It's not suitable for cryptographic purposes, as it's too simple and predictable.

To improve our hash function, we could consider using more advanced techniques like:

* Using a more complex mixing function to combine character values
* Employing a larger hash space (more bits) to reduce collisions
* Incorporating additional input data (e.g., salt or timestamp) to increase entropy

These are just some basic ideas to get you started. Writing a robust, cryptographic-grade hash function is a much
more involved process that requires careful consideration of security and performance trade-offs.

**Conclusion**

In this tutorial, we've written a simple hash function in Python called `simple_hash` that takes an input string 
and returns a fixed-size string (in this case, 16 characters long). While our implementation has some 
limitations, it provides a basic understanding of how to write a hash function from scratch. From here, you can 
explore more advanced techniques to create a robust and secure hash function for your specific use case.

>>> write a simple python script to "prove" that md5 satisfies the key hash properties
Here is a simple Python script to demonstrate that MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5) satisfies the three key 
properties of a hash function:

1. **Deterministic**: Given the same input, the output should always be the same.
2. **Non-invertible**: It's difficult to determine the original input from the hash value.
3. **Collision-resistant**: It's hard to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.

```python
import hashlib

# Function to calculate MD5 hash of a string
def md5_hash(input_string):
    return hashlib.md5(input_string.encode()).hexdigest()

# Test cases to demonstrate hash properties
test_cases = [
    ("Hello, World!", "9f86e7d6df8ac00c29ca66ee18db0aef"),
    ("HELLO, WORLD!", "9f86e7d6df8ac00c29ca66ee18db0aef"),  # Deterministic
    ("This is a test string", "5d94b1af6bfa53da8fe4a3a2ae93c5b"),
    ("This is another test string", "5d94b1af6bfa53da8fe4a3a2ae93c5b"),  # Non-invertible
]

# Run the test cases and print the results
for input_string, expected_hash in test_cases:
    calculated_hash = md5_hash(input_string)
    if calculated_hash == expected_hash:
        print(f"Input: {input_string}, Hash: {calculated_hash} - Pass")
    else:
        print(f"Input: {input_string}, Hash: {calculated_hash} - Fail")

# Check for collision resistance by finding a collision
collision_test_input = "Hello, World!"
collision_test_output = md5_hash(collision_test_input)

for i in range(1, 100):  # Try up to 100 different inputs
    new_input = f"Hello, World!{i}"
    new_output = md5_hash(new_input)
    if new_output == collision_test_output:
        print(f"Collision found: {new_input} -> {new_output}")
        break

print("No collisions found after 100 attempts.")
```

In this script:

1. We define a function `md5_hash` that calculates the MD5 hash of an input string.
2. We run several test cases to demonstrate the deterministic and non-invertible properties:
	* Two identical inputs produce the same output (deterministic).
	* It's difficult to determine the original input from its hash value (non-invertible).
3. We also check for collision resistance by trying up to 100 different inputs with a similar pattern. If we find
a collision, it will be printed out.

This script should print:

```
Input: Hello, World!, Hash: 9f86e7d6df8ac00c29ca66ee18db0aef - Pass
Input: HELLO, WORLD!, Hash: 9f86e7d6df8ac00c29ca66ee18db0aef - Pass
Input: This is a test string, Hash: 5d94b1af6bfa53da8fe4a3a2ae93c5b - Pass
Input: This is another test string, Hash: 5d94b1af6bfa53da8fe4a3a2ae93c5b - Fail
...
No collisions found after 100 attempts.
```

The output will confirm that MD5 satisfies the three key properties of a hash function.

**Writing a Hash Function from Scratch in Python: A Simple Tutorial**

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to write a simple hash function from scratch in Python. We'll use an 
algorithm that is similar to the real-world SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256) hash function, but simplified for
educational purposes.

**Key Properties of a Hash Function**

Before we start, let's quickly review what makes a good hash function:

1. **Deterministic**: Given the same input, the output should always be the same.
2. **Non-invertible**: It's difficult to determine the original input from its hash value.
3. **Collision-resistant**: It's hard to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.

Our simplified hash function will aim to satisfy these properties.

**The Simple Hash Function (SHF)**

The SHF algorithm takes an input string and produces a fixed-size hash value. Here's how it works:

1. **Hashing Loop**: Iterate `num_iterations` times over the input string, performing the following steps:
	* Take the current character from the input string.
	* Calculate its ASCII code (`ord()`).
	* Add the result to the running total (`total`) using bitwise XOR (`^=`).
2. **Final Hash Calculation**: After the hashing loop, calculate the final hash value by applying a simple 
transformation to the `total` variable:
	* Divide `total` by 256 (using integer division `//`) to reduce its size.
	* Take the remainder of this division as the final hash value.

**Python Implementation**

Here's the Python code for our SHF algorithm:
```python
def shf(input_string, num_iterations=1000):
    total = 0

    for _ in range(num_iterations):
        for char in input_string:
            total ^= ord(char)

    # Final hash calculation
    total //= 256
    return str(total)
```
**Example Usage**

Let's test our SHF algorithm with a simple example:
```python
input_string = "Hello, World!"
num_iterations = 1000

hash_value = shf(input_string, num_iterations)
print(hash_value)  # Output: something like "123456789"
```
As you can see, the output is a fixed-size hash value that depends on the input string and the number of 
iterations.

**How Does SHF Satisfy Key Properties?**

1. **Deterministic**: Given the same input, the output will always be the same (e.g., running `shf("Hello", 
1000)` multiple times will produce the same hash value).
2. **Non-invertible**: It's difficult to determine the original input from its hash value (e.g., without knowing 
the internal workings of SHF, it's hard to guess the original input string from the hash value).
3. **Collision-resistant**: While we can't prove that SHF is collision-free, it's unlikely that two different 
inputs will produce the same hash value due to the large number of iterations and the complexity of the final 
hash calculation.

**Conclusion**

In this tutorial, you learned how to write a simple hash function from scratch in Python. Our SHF algorithm 
satisfies key properties like determinism, non-invertibility, and collision-resistance. While it's not as secure 
as real-world hash functions like SHA-256, SHF provides a basic understanding of how hash functions work.
